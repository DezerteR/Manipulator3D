My master thesis, written in 2015, quite rough due to concentration on robotics related part: invese kinematics and path planning.

Quick summary written after 4 years:

Inverse kinematics was based on 'transposed jacobian' method which allows to handle efectively manipulators with redundant joints.

Path plannig is simple A* implementation in 3D space, to detect and avoid obstacles I used Bullet physics engine. Bullet is feed from 3D scene,
